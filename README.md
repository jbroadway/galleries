# Simple Galleries

This is a very simple photo gallery app for the [Elefant CMS](http://www.elefantcms.com/).
Galleries are simply folders under Tools > Files with a bit of metadata attached,
sorted by date or alphabetically.

Galleries can be embedded into any page via the Dynamic Objects button in the WYSIWYG
editor, or accessed via the `/galleries` URL, which you can add to your site navigation
by visiting Tools > Navigation and dragging the `Galleries` page into your site tree.

## Installation

Go to Tools > Designer > Install App/Theme and paste the following link:

	https://github.com/jbroadway/galleries/archive/master.zip

Or enter the following on the command line:

	cd /path/to/your/website
	./elefant install https://github.com/jbroadway/courses/archive/master.zip
